# File Transfer Application

This repository contains a simple Java-based file transfer application consisting of a server and a client component. The application allows users to send and receive files over a local network.

## Client

The client component enables users to select a file and send it to the server. Similar to the server, the client has a Java Swing GUI.

### How to Run the Client

1. Compile and run the `client.java` file.
2. The client GUI will appear, allowing you to choose a file and send it to the server.

## Server

The server component is responsible for receiving files from clients. It has a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java Swing, showcasing received files. The server runs on port 3456 and awaits incoming connections.

### How to Run the Server

1. Compile and run the `server.java` file.
2. The server GUI will appear, displaying the list of received files.

## Usage

1. **Server Setup:**
   - Run the server on the machine where you want to receive files.
   - The server GUI will display received files.

2. **Client Usage:**
   - Run the client on a machine connected to the server's local network.
   - Choose a file using the "Choose File" button.
   - Click "Send File" to initiate the file transfer to the server.

## Notes

- The application supports text files (`.txt`) for previewing purposes on the server.
- Ensure the server is running before attempting file transfers from the client.
